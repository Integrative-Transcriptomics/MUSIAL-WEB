## **Description**:

![MUSIAL Logo](musialweb/musialweb/static/resources/logo.png)

MUSIAL is a web platform that computes prokaryotic genome, gene and protein sequence alignments from variant call datasets (using both SNVs and Indels) derived from multiple samples of one species. Scientists can assess the variability of a species on the genome, gene, and protein sequence level, e.g., study which positions in the species exhibit large or no variability, identify genes with large variability, which samples agree on which proteoforms, etc. The platform is designed to support the detection of features of interest for downstream analyses. It provides multiple data export options for FASTA as well as tabular formats.

## **Access**:

As an alternative to using MUSIAL locally, you can access the software via a webserver at https://tuevis.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/. You will find example data as well as descriptions on how to work with the webserver at the page itself. A major part of the server's backend source code is vailable at https://github.com/Integrative-Transcriptomics/MUSIAL.
